Alright. Let's start.

<br>

### What is Mulyankan?
Mulyankan is a online paper checking app that is tailored to teachers. It is **completely online** and **free to use**. It has a simple interface which ensures that you can start checking papers in a couple of minutes.<br>

<br>

### What Mulyankan isn't?
It is important to clear some misconceptions poeple might have about the app. Mulyankan is **not an student management system or an online test platform**.<br>
It stays true to the Indian Education System facilitating personal attention that every student receives from the teacher through manual paper checking. That being said, Mulyankan does make it easier to check papers.

### Purpose
The purpose of Mulyankan is to enable teachers to check the exam paper that students send in PDF, PNG, JPEG, etc. formats. Teachers can check papers using symbols like ✔, ❌, ⭕ and more. Marks can be added using _mark boxes_ which can be automatically calculated and inserted using _quick marking_. The checked papers can then be downloaded in PDF form. This will be disucssed in detail below and in the following sections.
