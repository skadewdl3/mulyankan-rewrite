### Adding Symbols
Adding symbols is very easy with Mulyankans _drag-and-drop_ interface. You can see all the available symbols in the sidebar to the left. To add a symbol, click-and-hold on the symbols and drag it onto the editing area.

### Removing Symbols
You can remove symbols by _right-clicking_ on the symbol and selecting remove. Alternatively, you could drag the symbol out of the page to remove it too.

### Zooming
Sometimes, a PDF has a large/small size page. You can zoom in/out to make the page smaller or bigger. You can click _Zoom In_ button in the Menu Bar to zoom in. You can click the _Zoom Out_ button in the Menu Bar to zoom out.

Clicking the _Reset Zoom_ button sets the size of page to initial size (the one you say when the pdf opened).

In the next section, we will cover adding text and using Mulyankans automatic marking system.
